# zegami-cli
A Command Line Interface for [Zegami](https://www.zegami.com).

Zegami is a visual data exploration tool that makes the analysis of large collections of image rich information quick and simple.

# Installation
```
pip3 install zegami-cli[sql]
```

# Commands

## Login
The login command promtps for username and password which is then used to retrieve a long-lived API token which can be used for subsequent requests. The token is stored in a file in the currenet users data directory.
Once retrieved all subsequest commands will use the stored token, unless it is specifically overridden wiht the `--token` option
```
zeg login
```

## Get a collection
Get the details of a collection.
If the `collection id` is excluded then all collections will be listed.
```
zeg get collections [collection id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```

## Update a collection
Update a collection - *coming soon*.

## Delete a collection
Delete a collection
```
zeg delete collections [collection id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```

## Publish a collection
```
zeg publish collection [collection id] --project [Project Id] --config [path to configuration yaml] --token [API token]
```

The config `yaml` file is used to specify additional configuration for the collection publish.
```
# The type of update. For now this needs to be set to 'publish'
update_type: publish
# Config for the publish update type
publish_config:
# Flag to indicate if the collection should be published or unpublished
    publish: true
# The id of the project to publish to
    destination_project: public
```

## Get a data set
Get a data set
```
zeg get dataset [dataset id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```

## Update a data set
Update an existing data set with new data.
```
zeg update dataset [dataset id] --project [Project Id] --config [path to configuration yaml] --token [API token]
```

The config `yaml` file is used to specify additional configuration for the data set update. There are *two* supported `dataset_type` supported.

### File
The `file` type is used to update a data set with a file. It can be set up to either specify the fully qualified path to a `.csv.`, `.tsv` or `.xlsx` file to upload using the `path` property *or* the `directory` property can be used to upload the latest file in a directory location.
```
# The type of data set. For now this needs to be set to 'file'
dataset_type: file
# Config for the file data set type
file_config:
# Path to the dataset file
    path:
# Or path to a directory that contains data files.
# Only the latest file that matches the accepted extensions (.csv, .tsv, .xlsx)
# will be uploaded. This is useful for creating collections based on
# automated exports from a system, like log files.
    directory:
```

### SQL
The `sql` type is used to update a data set based on an `SQL` query.
Uses SQLAlchemy to connect to the database. See http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html and https://www.connectionstrings.com/ for the correct connection string format.

```
# The type of data set. For now this needs to be set to 'file'
dataset_type: sql
# Config for the sql data set type
sql_config:
# The connection string.
    connection:
# SQL query
    query:
```

## Delete a data set
Delete a data set - *coming soon*.
```
zeg delete dataset [dataset id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```

## Get an image set
Get an image set - *coming soon*.
```
zeg get imageset [imageset id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```

## Update an image set
Update an image set with new images.
```
zeg update imageset [imageset id] --project [Project Id] --config [path to configuration yaml] --token [API token]
```

The config `yaml` file is used to specify additional configuration for the image set update.

### File imageset

The `paths` property is used to specify the location of images to upload and can include both images and directories.


```
# The type of image set. for now this needs to be set to 'file'
imageset_type: file
# Config for the file image set type
file_config:
# A collection of paths. Paths can be to both images and directories
    paths:
        - an_image.jpg
        - a/directory/path
# Unique identifier of the collection
collection_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Unique identifier of the collection data set
dataset_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Name of the column in the dataset that contains the image name
dataset_column: image_name
```

### URL imageset

The dataset_column property is used to set the column where the url is stored. You will need to include the full image url e.g. https://zegami.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/weatherall.svg

```
# The type of image set. for now this needs to be set to 'url'
imageset_type: url
# Unique identifier of the collection
collection_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Unique identifier of the collection data set
dataset_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Name of the column in the dataset that contains the image url
dataset_column: image_name
# Url pattern - python format string where {} is the name of the image name (from data file)
url_template: https://example.com/images/{}?accesscode=abc3e20423423497
```

### Azure storage imageset

```
# The type of image set. for now this needs to be set to 'url'
imageset_type: azure_storage_container
# Name of the container
container_name: my_azure_blobs
# Unique identifier of the collection
collection_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Unique identifier of the collection data set
dataset_id: 5ad3a99b75f3b30001732f36
# Name of the column in the dataset that contains the image url
dataset_column: image_name

# Note that the storage account connection string should also be made available via environment variable AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
```

## Delete an image set
Delete an image set - *coming soon*.
```
zeg delete imageset [imageset id] --project [Project Id] --token [API token]
```
